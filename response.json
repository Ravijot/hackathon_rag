Understanding this flow helps clarify how seamless and secure transactions occur within the UPI ecosystem.\n\nPUSH: Streamlined Payment Initiation and Authorisation\n\nPush transactions in UPI allow users to initiate payments directly from their accounts to transfer funds to a recipient. This method is commonly used for purchases, bill payments, or sending money to friends and family.\n\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Authorisation\n\nInitiating the Transaction: Customers use their UPI-enabled apps to enter recipient details, the transaction amount, and any optional notes.\n\nRouting the Request: The customer’s app forwards the transaction request to their chosen Payment Service Provider (PSP), which acts as an intermediary.\n\nVerification by NPCI: The PSP routes the request to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), overseeing UPI transactions.\n\nBank Verification: The issuing bank (the sender’s bank) verifies the transaction’s authenticity, checks account balance, and confirms customer credentials.\n\nAuthorisation: Upon verification, the issuing bank authorizes the transaction and generates a digital signature for security.\n\nPhase 2: Verification and Fund Transfer\n\nDetail Sharing: The PSP shares the sender’s bank details with the UPI system for verification and routing.\n\nFunds Deduction: The NPCI checks account details and fund availability. If sufficient funds are available, the NPCI triggers the deduction from the sender’s account.\n\nCredit to Recipient: The acquiring bank (receiver’s bank) receives the transaction amount and credits it to the payee’s account.\n\nTransaction Confirmation: The UPI server sends a response to the customer’s app, confirming the successful transaction and providing a reference ID.\n\nUPI payment flow chart of intent payment\n\nPULL: Controlled Payment Requests and Execution\n\nPull transactions occur when the recipient initiates a request for funds from the sender. This method is often used for bill payments or collecting payments from customers, ensuring secure fund retrieval.\n\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Payment Message Flow\n\nRecipient Initiation: The recipient generates a payment request through their UPI-enabled app.\n\nPayment Request Flow: The request is sent to the NPCI, indicating the intention to pull funds from the payer.\n\nPhase 2: Transaction Flow between Banks\n\nRouting the Request: The payment request reaches the creditor’s bank, which forwards it to the debtor’s bank via the NPCI.\n\nVerification by Debtor’s Bank: The debtor’s bank verifies the request, checks the customer’s account details, and available balance.\n\nTransaction Approval: If funds are sufficient, the debtor’s bank approves the transaction and confirms it with the NPCI.\n\nCompleting the Transaction: The debtor’s bank transfers the requested amount to the creditor’s bank, completing the transaction.\n\nflow chart of collect UPI\n\nParticipants in UPI\n\nTo understand how UPI transactions work, it’s essential to recognize the key participants involved:\n\n1.
