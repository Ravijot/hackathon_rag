Unified Payments Interface Features and How UPI Works\\n\\nMarch 24, 2025 21 Mins Read\\n\\nHow UPI Works?\\n\\nShare\\n\\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email\\n\\nUPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is a real-time digital payment system that allows users to send money, pay bills, and manage accounts through one app. This article explains what UPI is, how it works, and its key features, helping you understand its role in simplifying digital payments.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWhat are Instant Payments?\\n\\nInstant payments allow financial transactions to be processed and settled within seconds using modern payment systems like Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and Immediate Payment Systems (IPS). Many of these systems operate 24/7, ensuring real-time fund transfers.\\n\\nAs a fast and secure alternative to traditional payment methods, instant payments play a key role in improving customer experience and boosting efficiency in digital finance.\\n\\nWhat is Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in Banking?\\n\\nThe full form of UPI is Unified Payments Interface, a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that facilitates instant money transfers between bank accounts via smartphones. UPI enables users to send and receive money, pay bills, and make online purchases seamlessly through a single mobile app.\\n\\nUPI eliminates the need to enter detailed bank information for each transaction, simplifying payments through QR codes, virtual payment addresses (VPAs), or UPI-registered mobile numbers.\\n\\nUPI works by leveraging existing systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), to ensure seamless payment settlement between bank accounts.\\n\\nRelated Read: What is UPI Lite? How Does it Work, and its Benefits\\n\\nHow Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Payment Works in India?\\n\\nUPI operates on a simple yet effective framework that streamlines digital transactions. Here’s how it works:\\n\\nStep 1. User Registration\\n\\nTo use UPI, users first download a UPI-enabled app, such as PhonePe, Google Pay, or Paytm. After installation, they register by linking their bank account and creating a unique virtual payment address (VPA), such as user@bankname, which serves as their UPI ID.\\n\\nStep 2. Initiating a Transaction\\n\\nWhen a user wants to make a payment, they can do so by selecting the payee’s VPA (e.g., merchant@bankname), scanning a QR code, or entering their UPI ID. For instance, if a customer wants to pay a local merchant, they can simply scan the merchant’s QR code or enter the merchant’s VPA.\\n\\nStep 3. Authentication\\n\\nTo authorize the transaction, users must enter their UPI PIN—a secure six-digit code created during registration. This step ensures that only the account holder can approve transactions.\\n\\nStep 4. Transaction Processing:\\n\\nOnce the UPI PIN is entered, the app sends the payment request to the UPI server. The server verifies the request and processes it by communicating with the user’s bank (the issuer) and the recipient’s bank (the acquirer).\\n\\nStep 5. Confirmation\\n\\nAfter the banks confirm the transaction, the user receives an instant notification regarding the success or failure of the payment. For example, the app might display a message like “Payment of ₹500 to merchant@bankname successful.”\\n\\nStep 6. Settlement\\n\\nThe UPI system ensures the funds are settled between banks within a short time frame, usually within a few hours, although users see the transaction reflected in their accounts immediately.\\n\\nThis seamless process, facilitated by apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm, makes UPI an efficient, secure, and convenient method for digital transactions, contributing to its widespread adoption in India.\\n\\nRelated Read: Bima ASBA by IRDAI: A Game-Changer for UPI Insurance Payments', 'UPI Transaction Flow\\n\\nThe UPI transaction flow outlines the steps involved in processing payments, whether initiated by the sender (push) or requested by the recipient (pull). Understanding this flow helps clarify how seamless and secure transactions occur within the UPI ecosystem.\\n\\nPUSH: Streamlined Payment Initiation and Authorisation\\n\\nPush transactions in UPI allow users to initiate payments directly from their accounts to transfer funds to a recipient. This method is commonly used for purchases, bill payments, or sending money to friends and family.\\n\\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Authorisation\\n\\nInitiating the Transaction: Customers use their UPI-enabled apps to enter recipient details, the transaction amount, and any optional notes.\\n\\nRouting the Request: The customer’s app forwards the transaction request to their chosen Payment Service Provider (PSP), which acts as an intermediary.\\n\\nVerification by NPCI: The PSP routes the request to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), overseeing UPI transactions.\\n\\nBank Verification: The issuing bank (the sender’s bank) verifies the transaction’s authenticity, checks account balance, and confirms customer credentials.\\n\\nAuthorisation: Upon verification, the issuing bank authorizes the transaction and generates a digital signature for security.\\n\\nPhase 2: Verification and Fund Transfer\\n\\nDetail Sharing: The PSP shares the sender’s bank details with the UPI system for verification and routing.\\n\\nFunds Deduction: The NPCI checks account details and fund availability. If sufficient funds are available, the NPCI triggers the deduction from the sender’s account.\\n\\nCredit to Recipient: The acquiring bank (receiver’s bank) receives the transaction amount and credits it to the payee’s account.\\n\\nTransaction Confirmation: The UPI server sends a response to the customer’s app, confirming the successful transaction and providing a reference ID.\\n\\nUPI payment flow chart of intent payment\\n\\nPULL: Controlled Payment Requests and Execution\\n\\nPull transactions occur when the recipient initiates a request for funds from the sender. This method is often used for bill payments or collecting payments from customers, ensuring secure fund retrieval.\\n\\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Payment Message Flow\\n\\nRecipient Initiation: The recipient generates a payment request through their UPI-enabled app.\\n\\nPayment Request Flow: The request is sent to the NPCI, indicating the intention to pull funds from the payer.\\n\\nPhase 2: Transaction Flow between Banks\\n\\nRouting the Request: The payment request reaches the creditor’s bank, which forwards it to the debtor’s bank via the NPCI.\\n\\nVerification by Debtor’s Bank: The debtor’s bank verifies the request, checks the customer’s account details, and available balance.\\n\\nTransaction Approval: If funds are sufficient, the debtor’s bank approves the transaction and confirms it with the NPCI.\\n\\nCompleting the Transaction: The debtor’s bank transfers the requested amount to the creditor’s bank, completing the transaction.\\n\\nflow chart of collect UPI\\n\\nParticipants in UPI\\n\\nTo understand how UPI transactions work, it’s essential to recognize the key participants involved:\\n\\n1. Payer App/Payment Service Provider (PSP)\\n\\nThe journey begins with the payer app, such as Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm. Users initiate transactions by entering the recipient’s details and transaction amount.\\n\\nList of major UPI apps and their respective sponsor banks:\\n\\nUPI App/PSPs Sponsor Banks Handles Google Pay Axis @okaxis ICICI @okicici HDFC @okhdfcbank SBI @oksbi Phonepe Yes @ybl ICICI @ibl Axis @axl Amazon Pay Axis @apl WhatsApp Payments ICICI Bank @okicici Airtel Payments Bank Kotak Mahindra Bank @Kotak Paytm ICICI Bank @okicici BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) @upi\\n\\nRelated Read: How to Change UPI ID in Google Pay?', '2.

Unified Payments Interface Features and How UPI Works\\n\\nMarch 24, 2025 21 Mins Read\\n\\nHow UPI Works?\\n\\nShare\\n\\nShare on Facebook Share on Twitter LinkedIn Email\\n\\nUPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is a real-time digital payment system that allows users to send money, pay bills, and manage accounts through one app. This article explains what UPI is, how it works, and its key features, helping you understand its role in simplifying digital payments.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWhat are Instant Payments?\\n\\nInstant payments allow financial transactions to be processed and settled within seconds using modern payment systems like Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and Immediate Payment Systems (IPS). Many of these systems operate 24/7, ensuring real-time fund transfers.\\n\\nAs a fast and secure alternative to traditional payment methods, instant payments play a key role in improving customer experience and boosting efficiency in digital finance.\\n\\nWhat is Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in Banking?\\n\\nThe full form of UPI is Unified Payments Interface, a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that facilitates instant money transfers between bank accounts via smartphones. UPI enables users to send and receive money, pay bills, and make online purchases seamlessly through a single mobile app.\\n\\nUPI eliminates the need to enter detailed bank information for each transaction, simplifying payments through QR codes, virtual payment addresses (VPAs), or UPI-registered mobile numbers.\\n\\nUPI works by leveraging existing systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), to ensure seamless payment settlement between bank accounts.\\n\\nRelated Read: What is UPI Lite? How Does it Work, and its Benefits\\n\\nHow Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Payment Works in India?\\n\\nUPI operates on a simple yet effective framework that streamlines digital transactions. Here’s how it works:\\n\\nStep 1. User Registration\\n\\nTo use UPI, users first download a UPI-enabled app, such as PhonePe, Google Pay, or Paytm. After installation, they register by linking their bank account and creating a unique virtual payment address (VPA), such as user@bankname, which serves as their UPI ID.\\n\\nStep 2. Initiating a Transaction\\n\\nWhen a user wants to make a payment, they can do so by selecting the payee’s VPA (e.g., merchant@bankname), scanning a QR code, or entering their UPI ID. For instance, if a customer wants to pay a local merchant, they can simply scan the merchant’s QR code or enter the merchant’s VPA.\\n\\nStep 3. Authentication\\n\\nTo authorize the transaction, users must enter their UPI PIN—a secure six-digit code created during registration. This step ensures that only the account holder can approve transactions.\\n\\nStep 4. Transaction Processing:\\n\\nOnce the UPI PIN is entered, the app sends the payment request to the UPI server. The server verifies the request and processes it by communicating with the user’s bank (the issuer) and the recipient’s bank (the acquirer).\\n\\nStep 5. Confirmation\\n\\nAfter the banks confirm the transaction, the user receives an instant notification regarding the success or failure of the payment. For example, the app might display a message like “Payment of ₹500 to merchant@bankname successful.”\\n\\nStep 6. Settlement\\n\\nThe UPI system ensures the funds are settled between banks within a short time frame, usually within a few hours, although users see the transaction reflected in their accounts immediately.\\n\\nThis seamless process, facilitated by apps like PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm, makes UPI an efficient, secure, and convenient method for digital transactions, contributing to its widespread adoption in India.\\n\\nRelated Read: Bima ASBA by IRDAI: A Game-Changer for UPI Insurance Payments', 'UPI Transaction Flow\\n\\nThe UPI transaction flow outlines the steps involved in processing payments, whether initiated by the sender (push) or requested by the recipient (pull). Understanding this flow helps clarify how seamless and secure transactions occur within the UPI ecosystem.\\n\\nPUSH: Streamlined Payment Initiation and Authorisation\\n\\nPush transactions in UPI allow users to initiate payments directly from their accounts to transfer funds to a recipient. This method is commonly used for purchases, bill payments, or sending money to friends and family.\\n\\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Authorisation\\n\\nInitiating the Transaction: Customers use their UPI-enabled apps to enter recipient details, the transaction amount, and any optional notes.\\n\\nRouting the Request: The customer’s app forwards the transaction request to their chosen Payment Service Provider (PSP), which acts as an intermediary.\\n\\nVerification by NPCI: The PSP routes the request to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), overseeing UPI transactions.\\n\\nBank Verification: The issuing bank (the sender’s bank) verifies the transaction’s authenticity, checks account balance, and confirms customer credentials.\\n\\nAuthorisation: Upon verification, the issuing bank authorizes the transaction and generates a digital signature for security.\\n\\nPhase 2: Verification and Fund Transfer\\n\\nDetail Sharing: The PSP shares the sender’s bank details with the UPI system for verification and routing.\\n\\nFunds Deduction: The NPCI checks account details and fund availability. If sufficient funds are available, the NPCI triggers the deduction from the sender’s account.\\n\\nCredit to Recipient: The acquiring bank (receiver’s bank) receives the transaction amount and credits it to the payee’s account.\\n\\nTransaction Confirmation: The UPI server sends a response to the customer’s app, confirming the successful transaction and providing a reference ID.\\n\\nUPI payment flow chart of intent payment\\n\\nPULL: Controlled Payment Requests and Execution\\n\\nPull transactions occur when the recipient initiates a request for funds from the sender. This method is often used for bill payments or collecting payments from customers, ensuring secure fund retrieval.\\n\\nPhase 1: Transaction Initiation and Payment Message Flow\\n\\nRecipient Initiation: The recipient generates a payment request through their UPI-enabled app.\\n\\nPayment Request Flow: The request is sent to the NPCI, indicating the intention to pull funds from the payer.\\n\\nPhase 2: Transaction Flow between Banks\\n\\nRouting the Request: The payment request reaches the creditor’s bank, which forwards it to the debtor’s bank via the NPCI.\\n\\nVerification by Debtor’s Bank: The debtor’s bank verifies the request, checks the customer’s account details, and available balance.\\n\\nTransaction Approval: If funds are sufficient, the debtor’s bank approves the transaction and confirms it with the NPCI.\\n\\nCompleting the Transaction: The debtor’s bank transfers the requested amount to the creditor’s bank, completing the transaction.\\n\\nflow chart of collect UPI\\n\\nParticipants in UPI\\n\\nTo understand how UPI transactions work, it’s essential to recognize the key participants involved:\\n\\n1. Payer App/Payment Service Provider (PSP)\\n\\nThe journey begins with the payer app, such as Google Pay, PhonePe, or Paytm.

In many ways, it\\'s what I wanted Hug to be - it\\'s really inspiring to see someone build that.\"\\n\\nTimothy Crosley - Hug creator (ref)\\n\\n\"If you\\'re looking to learn one modern framework for building REST APIs, check out FastAPI [...] It\\'s fast, easy to use and easy to learn [...]\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve switched over to FastAPI for our APIs [...] I think you\\'ll like it [...]\"\\n\\nInes Montani - Matthew Honnibal - Explosion AI founders - spaCy creators (ref) - (ref)\\n\\n\"If anyone is looking to build a production Python API, I would highly recommend FastAPI. It is beautifully designed, simple to use and highly scalable, it has become a key component in our API first development strategy and is driving many automations and services such as our Virtual TAC Engineer.\"\\n\\nDeon Pillsbury - Cisco (ref)\\n\\nTyper, the FastAPI of CLIs { #typer-the-fastapi-of-clis }\\n\\nIf you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out Typer.\\n\\nTyper is FastAPI\\'s little sibling.
